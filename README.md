# Programming-Basics

This is my repository for basic tools in programming and numerical methods with c++, python, mathematica and some useful scripts with bash. Mainly thought for physicist.
Some of the topics related in each folder are listed below.
This is based on prof. W. Oquendo's course on Programming and introduction to numerical methods at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

## 1 Introduction
Types of variables in c++ and python, reading and writing information from and to screen or files.
## 2 Functions
Basic declaration, implementation and usage of functions
## 3 Root Finding
Four methods to find roots of any function:
* Bisection
* Regula-Falsi
* Fixed point
* Newton

## 4 Numerical Derivatives
Three common and simple algorithms to find numerical derivatives:
* Forward derivative
* Central derivative
* Richardson for central and forward derivatives.
